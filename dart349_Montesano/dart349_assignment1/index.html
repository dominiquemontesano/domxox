			<h1>Who am I</h1>
			<p>I am a multi-medium artist specializing in film work, painting, embroidery and film photography. I also dabble in wood work.I'm not too sure what body of work to share here but I would like to share an exerpt from a book I wrote last semester for my typography class. A book I curated and built myself. I engraved the pages using the VC lab at school.</p>

						<b>"WHAT IS PRODUCTIVITY? IT'S A MESSY QUESTION FOR ME, WRITTING THIS BOOK. NOT ONLY FOR SCHOOL BUT ABOUT MY FEELINGS. GIVES ME A SENSE OF SATISFACTION. EXCEPT, THE ANSWER WILL BE DIFFERENT FOR EVERYONE. IT MIGHT HAVE TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT I'LL GET A REWARD FOR IT. LIKE A GOOD GRADE FOR EXAMPLE. 
CALCULATING YOUR LIFE. THAT'S ALWAYS MOTIVATION FOR ME TO LEAVE BY HOUR DAY BY DAY. DO WELL IN SCHOOL AND DON'T LET IT DRIVE YOU TO MADNESS. MAKE THE HELL OF THAT RIDE BE YOUR WORTH YOUR WHILE"</b>

			<p>My biggest fear is, not being able to finish something i'm really passionate about in the moment, I’m scared that, I don’t have enough time in a day to complete just awesome goals of mine. That they will just vanish and not be done and forgotten about.
