   <h3 class="title">Design: 9/10</h3>
   <p>The design for this website is very interactive for tying together what seems to be a russian brand. The designer chose somber background colors withbright colors circled into sections. This site draws you in. </p>
   
   <h3 class="title">Usability: 8/10</h3>
   <p>Besides it being a language I can't understand (lol) It looks quite user-friendly. The home page takes a good 30 seconds to bring you to the content and kind of brings you in the future with this effect of movement and blurring. </p>
  The more you click-click, the more content is made available. 
   <h3>Creativity: 8/10</h3>
   <p>This website is a great example of interactive media. It is far from boring. </p>
   
   <h3>Content: 10/10</h3>
   <p>The website is a collection of cinematic photographs for a clothing brand.</p>
