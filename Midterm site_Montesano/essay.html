class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the last decade, there has been a lot more visibility in terms of sexuality and it&rsquo;s defining terms. The world is less black and white now. Social penalties for being homosexual used to be extremely intense. Love is no longer just a heteronormative term, yet some have not yet come to the realization of these changes. The personal experience I have with this is my own coming out; It was an easy thing for me to do. Speaking as a white, privileged and aware North American should. However, I&rsquo;m still coming out, everyday to strangers. You see, coming out comes with it&rsquo;s own mini sacrifices. This is something no one really told me about and I had to learn it for myself, you almost never stop doing it. This becomes a defining label in your life. It is important for me to work on this website as a reminder for allies or other members of the queer community, that when we encounter new people, we will keep coming out of the closet. I want to dissect how it is not only a privilege to come out, yet also a luxury to choose to live freely and openly in 2019.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>Link to map of criminilization in coutnries across the world </span><span class="c14"><a class="c10" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.humandignitytrust.org/lgbt-the-law/map-of-criminalisation/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1571767883508000">https://www.humandignitytrust.org/lgbt-the-law/map-of-criminalisation/</a></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">As of 2019, when I look at the human dignity maps, 72 countries still have jurisdiction criminalizing members of the LGBTQ+ family. 12 of these in which the death penalty is legal. A closet that was created by homophobia. The expression was an oppressive and derogatory term for so long. It was used to take our gay skeleton out of the closet and shame us. This is particularly a case by case experience. Some still choose to be offended by it while others use it as empowerment because the only way is out. These situations vary from one queer to another. Yet most of us are bonded together by our constantly faced fear and discomfort with the awkwardness of being confronted over and over again about who we kiss and who we love.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>I don&#39;t fault anyone for hiding a part of their identity to stay close to someone. To save their relationship and bond. To avoid being imprisoned or stoned to death because of cultural differences. Telling your parents you are gay can completly tranform your relationship from child to parent. Allowing the government and social justice system of your region to discover your sexuality can endanger your future. To have a loving family and support system you sometimes have to hide a part of yourself. To succeed and develop as a citizen, you sometimes have to keep your secrets hidden in your closet until you get home. However, being true to yourself with your family, with the ones around you, leads you closer to your authentic self. Some choose to remain in the closet, despite the decline in societal pressures for queers and gays to remain quiet, which is a thing of the past in most countries. This is a pe</span><span class="c0">rsonal decision for them, for anyone really. Out or not, you are supported and loved. Discrimination is still occcuring around us and some people are still deeply wounded. It is a privilege for me to have come out and still been accepted by everyone around me. Sounds silly to say that, as I am a huge advocate for human rights, yet as soon as someone goes against the grain of what I stand for, I walk away. Some people&rsquo;s perspectives can simply not be changed. This doesn&rsquo;t mean I spread hate, I just rather focus on my principles. I rather let them keep thinking that homophobia is their problem because in no way is it mine. They are not entitled to make me sad or embarrassed and that is something I am still learning to grasp everyday. I left the closet because life was intolerable hiding, no one can make me feel that way again. &ldquo;We can disagree and still love each other unless your disagreement is rooted in my oppression and denial of my humanity and right to exist&rdquo; (James Baldwin)</span></p><p class="c6"><span>Certain folks in queer communities haven&rsquo;t faced all the stigmas others have had. Those born in big towns vs small towns may have different stories to share. In places like the east or in south Asia, queers may never have the option of coming out as it would be dangerous for their lives. &ldquo;</span><span class="c17">I also believe that the attitude that queer people will be happier once they come out is an extremely privileged attitude to have. Sometimes, coming out can result in more harm than good. What about the queer youth dependent on financial support from queerphobic parents?&rdquo; (</span><span class="c7">Malena, Beth. &ldquo;Closet Vs. Backstage: the ECGSR 2019 Keynote Presentation.)</span><span>&nbsp;I believe this attitude is important to understand. Not all those in our spectrum have the privilege of being free, some may wait until they get their degrees, until they move away, until mom and dad have passed and that is okay. There is no rush because you know you&rsquo;re one of us, out or not. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c15">Proposal for out of class content:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I want to intertwine this final website with my PHOT 210 class for the above reasons. In my first level 35mm photography class, we are to develop a 10 print series with a creative and visual strategy of a theme. I proposed to my teacher Jinyoung Kim that I would like to explore a series of portraits explaining the world and ABC&rsquo;S of the LGBTQ+ members with a revolving question; &ldquo;how does it feel to keep coming out to people you&rsquo;ve just met, everyday?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I would like to speak about and design a website that can showcase my photo work in a visually pleasing manner.
